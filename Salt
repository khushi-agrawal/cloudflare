For patenting a salting mechanism and ensuring secure information storage, here are several aspects you could consider including:

### 1. **Salt Generation & Storage**
   - **Random Salt Generation**: Emphasize the method for generating unique, high-entropy salts for each transaction or user to prevent common attacks like rainbow table attacks.
   - **Secure Salt Storage**: Define where and how salts will be stored securely. This can include:
     - Using a **dedicated database** with strict access controls.
     - Storing salts separately from hashed data, so even if one is compromised, the other remains secure.
     - Encrypting the stored salts using a symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithm.

### 2. **Salting & Hashing Workflow**
   - **Dynamic Salting**: You could patent the idea of dynamically generating salts at different points in the transaction cycle, depending on factors like user behavior or transaction time.
   - **Double Salting**: You may explore combining both a global and unique user-specific salt, adding an extra layer of complexity to each hash.

### 3. **Secure Auditing & Tracking**
   - **Audit Logs**: Detail how each transaction's salting process can be audited, including logging the salt generation and usage without exposing sensitive data. For instance:
     - Using **non-reversible hashed values** of salts in the audit logs.
     - Time-stamping salt usage for each transaction.
     - Keeping logs **encrypted** and only accessible to authorized users.
  
### 4. **Salting in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Consider integrating salting into an MFA system where the salt is tied to a user's authentication token, making the salting process unique for each login.

### 5. **Key Management & Encryption**
   - **Key Derivation Functions (KDF)**: Use KDFs like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2 with salt to derive encryption keys, ensuring that even if the salt is known, brute-forcing is impractical.
   - **Secure Key Storage**: If encryption is part of the mechanism, consider including solutions for securely storing keys, such as using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

### 6. **Blockchain or Distributed Ledger for Salting**
   - Explore using blockchain for decentralized, immutable salt storage or recording, so that any tampering of the salt becomes easily detectable.

### 7. **Data Integrity and Salt Reuse Prevention**
   - Ensure that salts are never reused by timestamping or using a cryptographically secure random function. Reusing salts makes hash collisions more likely, weakening security.
   - Salt versioning, so older salts can be updated and tracked securely, could be a key aspect of your solution.

Including these elements can help in strengthening your patent and securing a unique, thorough mechanism for storing, salting, and auditing transaction data.
