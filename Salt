### **1. Problem Statement**

In an increasingly AI-driven world, the threat landscape has evolved to include sophisticated and highly realistic generative content capable of deceiving both humans and traditional detection systems. Malicious actors are exploiting generative AI (GenAI) technologies to fabricate synthetic data across multiple modalities, including video, audio, text, and documents. These hyper-realistic deepfakes are used to:

- Manipulate public perception via disinformation and fake news.
- Commit fraud through synthetic identities and impersonation in KYC processes.
- Bypass authentication mechanisms using cloned audio, spoofed video, or fabricated documents.
- Disrupt business workflows via AI-generated phishing, deepfake-based social engineering, and altered transaction records.

Traditional detection systems are ill-equipped to handle these threats. Most existing solutions are:

- **Siloed and modality-specific**, unable to cross-reference patterns across data types.
- **Heuristics-based**, depending on static rule sets that fail against adaptive generative models.
- **Opaque in decision-making**, offering no explainability or breakdown of why something was flagged.

As deepfakes evolve to integrate multiple modalities (e.g., video with synthetic voice and falsified text captions), the need for a **unified, intelligent, cross-modal detection system** becomes urgent. This system must operate with high accuracy, low latency, and provide explainable outcomes for both security teams and automated systems.

### **2. Technical Solution**

We propose a **modular, JEPA-powered disinformation detection architecture** that functions as a **Common Security Gateway**. This system validates the originality, authenticity, and temporal legitimacy of incoming data before it is accepted into any critical system.

The solution is centered around a **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) Umbrella**, which encapsulates several tightly integrated layers:

### **2.1 Input Handler**

The system begins with a Universal Input Handler that accepts and normalizes data from various channels:

- Multimedia uploads (KYC videos, voice samples)
- Textual documents (emails, scanned IDs)
- Real-time streams (calls, social media content)
- Structured or semi-structured content (e.g., transaction logs)

The handler ensures data is converted into a consistent, internally processable format and passes it into the JEPA Umbrella.

### **2.2 JEPA Umbrella**

The JEPA Umbrella is the semantic backbone of the system, responsible for orchestrated detection and cross-modal validation. It comprises the following core components:

### **2.2.1 Orchestration AI Layer**

- An intelligent dispatcher that evaluates input metadata, context, and modality.
- Routes content to appropriate downstream agents for validation.
- Ensures parallelism where needed (e.g., simultaneous processing of video and audio streams).

### **2.2.2 Cross-Entity Consensus Validation (CECV)**

- Performs external validation using third-party sources:
    - Certificate Authorities (for document or transaction signatures)
    - KYC vendors and identity databases
    - Blockchain logs for content publishing dates
- Generates a trust consensus score.
- Early intervention: If a claim fails validation, the system can block or escalate without consuming compute on deeper processing.

### **2.2.3 Modality-Specific JEPA Agents**

Each content type is routed to a corresponding detection module. These agents use advanced self-supervised learning models that operate on the raw input stream, reducing information loss and improving accuracy.

**A. Video JEPA Agent:**

- **Face Detection & Alignment**: Uses RetinaFace for robust facial region isolation.
- **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Multi-modal video transformers evaluate pixel-level abnormalities, lighting inconsistencies, unnatural blinking, jitter, and head motion.
- **3D Face Structure Consistency**: Ensures spatial coherence of facial geometry across frames.

**B. Audio JEPA Agent:**

- **Raw Waveform Processing**: SSL models like HuBERT, Wav2Vec2.0 process unaltered signals.
- **Artifact Detection**: Identifies spectral gaps, robotic tone, background inconsistencies, and missing microvariations in pitch and rhythm.
- **Prosodic Evaluation**: Captures unnatural intonation and emphasis patterns often missed by statistical models.

**C. Text JEPA Agent:**

- **Model Architecture**: Fine-tuned BERT model trained to classify human-written vs. AI-generated content.
- **Statistical Fingerprinting**: Evaluates perplexity, burstiness, repetitiveness, and semantic coherence.
- **Contextual Embedding Comparison**: Uses JEPA-style masked prediction to analyze sentence-level anomalies.

### **2.2.4 Multimodal Trust Verification Layer (MTVL)**

- Aggregates semantic embeddings from individual JEPA agents.
- Projects audio, video, and text representations into a shared latent space.
- Performs **cross-modal coherence validation**, checking:
    - Lip sync accuracy (video vs. audio)
    - Emotional tone alignment (audio prosody vs. facial expression)
    - Identity correlation (face vs. voice signature)
    - Text-image consistency (e.g., document scans vs. extracted content)

### **2.4 Final Decision Layer: Aggregation + XAI**

---

- **Data Fusion**: Combines results from JEPA agents, MTVL, CECV, and TOSS.
- **Trust Score Computation**: Numerical score representing overall authenticity confidence.
- **Verdict Classification**: Allow / Flag / Block
- **Explainability Engine**: Implements SHAP-based feature attribution to explain:
    - Which features triggered a flag.
    - Contribution of each modality.
    - Confidence intervals and potential false positive indicators.

### **3. Core Innovations and Non-Obvious Inventive Features**

1. **JEPA Umbrella as a Unified Validation Stack**: Unlike conventional detection systems that operate in isolation per modality, this system introduces a JEPA umbrella which integrates orchestration, consensus validation, modality-specific agents, and cross-modal fusion into a single predictive intelligence stack.
2. **Self-Supervised Modality Agents**: Utilization of JEPA-style self-supervised learning in raw waveform audio processing, pixel-level video analysis, and statistical text profiling eliminates reliance on labeled data and improves generalizability against novel threats.
3. **Cross-Entity Consensus Validation (CECV)**: This early-stage validation mechanism ensures only content with verifiable claims proceeds through compute-heavy analysis, optimizing performance and introducing an external trust dimension.
4. **Multimodal Latent Trust Layer (MTVL)**: A novel fusion module that cross-validates semantic alignment between video, audio, and text representations in a unified latent space — a unique method to detect inconsistency-based deepfakes.
5. **Explainable AI Verdict Mechanism**: Integrated SHAP-based interpretability at the verdict stage ensures regulatory compliance and user trust, setting it apart from black-box detection systems.
