4. Global Digital Collateral Registry for Micro-Loans & Leasing

üß† Real-World Problem:

In developing nations and low-income markets, small businesses can‚Äôt access loans because they can‚Äôt use their physical assets (e.g., machinery, tools, farm equipment) as verifiable, trackable collateral.

There‚Äôs no standardized, real-time system for lenders to:
	‚Ä¢	Verify ownership
	‚Ä¢	Ensure no double pledging
	‚Ä¢	Reclaim assets upon default

‚∏ª

üí° Patentable Solution:

A global digital collateral registry where:
	‚Ä¢	TokenFi is used to tokenize physical collateral (e.g., a tractor, solar panel)
	‚Ä¢	The ERC-3643 tokens are issued only to verified owners via ONCHAINID
	‚Ä¢	Lending platforms, banks, and microfinance firms interact with this token system to:
	‚Ä¢	Track who owns what
	‚Ä¢	Lock tokens during loan terms
	‚Ä¢	Reclaim ownership or initiate seizure if repayment fails

üîß Architecture Includes:
	‚Ä¢	TokenFi (tokenizing assets + compliance)
	‚Ä¢	Geotagging, photo verification or IoT (for physical proof)
	‚Ä¢	Smart lending contracts (on-chain logic for lending and seizure)
	‚Ä¢	Optional insurance & rating layers

üèÜ Why it‚Äôs novel:
	4.		‚Ä¢	First interoperable, real-time registry for real-world micro-asset loans
	5.		‚Ä¢	Decentralized yet legally verifiable
	6.		‚Ä¢	Replaces paper-based title systems
	7.
