Manage Risk – Progress & Demonstrated Outcomes

As part of my commitment to delivering secure, compliant, and stable systems, I proactively identified, tracked, and mitigated multiple operational, security, and compliance risks throughout 2025.

Non-Permitted Technologies (NPT) & Vulnerability Management
	•	Took end-to-end ownership of NPT tracking and vulnerability remediation within my scope.
	•	Performed weekly updates in the CM portal, ensuring transparency and audit readiness across teams.
	•	Actively drove follow-ups with application, infrastructure, and security teams to ensure timely remediation and closure of vulnerabilities.
	•	Maintained consistent communication with technical leads and stakeholders to close gaps, reduce exposure, and prevent risk accumulation.
	•	Helped strengthen overall compliance posture by ensuring risks were tracked, visible, and resolved within expected timelines.

End-of-Life (EOL) Technology Risk Reduction
	•	Actively worked on EOL remediation initiatives involving Teradata, Splunk, Trellix, Microsoft Visual Studio tools, and Microsoft Office Access Database Engine.
	•	Independently gathered, validated, and reconciled information across multiple teams where ownership and documentation were fragmented.
	•	Coordinated with application, infrastructure, security, and compliance stakeholders to assess usage, validate risk, and align on remediation or decommissioning paths.
	•	Contributed to reducing long-term operational and security risk by driving clarity and accountability in EOL actions.

Sensitive Data & Compliance Hygiene
	•	Ensured that systems and local environments under my responsibility did not contain sensitive, restricted, or compliance-risk data.
	•	Followed internal security and data-handling best practices to maintain a clean, compliant workspace.
	•	Proactively aligned daily work practices with the bank’s enterprise-level risk management and compliance standards.


Drive Operational Excellence – Progress & Demonstrated Outcomes

Throughout 2025, I focused on improving the quality, consistency, and efficiency of delivery by strengthening ownership, streamlining execution, and reducing operational friction across systems and teams.

End-to-End Ownership for Stable & Predictable Delivery
	•	In the Upload module, a large-scale and business-critical system, I focused on stability, efficiency, and minimal rework by managing all functional and technical aspects end to end — from requirement discussions and design clarification through deployment and post-release support.
	•	By acting as a single accountable owner and SME, I ensured clear decision-making, faster issue resolution, and reduced dependency-related delays.

Improved Communication & Handoff Efficiency
	•	Established a consistent communication rhythm with Line of Business and testing teams to ensure early requirement clarity and clean handoffs.
	•	This reduced back-and-forth cycles, minimized late-stage changes, and resulted in smoother and more predictable releases.

Operational Discipline Across BAU & New Intakes
	•	Applied structured execution practices across BAU deliverables and new intakes such as Dual Deposit PIN, ensuring alignment across middleware, UI, database, and testing teams.
	•	Proactively identified dependencies and risks early, helping avoid rework and schedule slippage.

System Stability & Issue Resolution
	•	Collaborated closely with DBAs and senior engineers to analyze backend flows and resolve database issues, improving system reliability and reducing repeat defects.
	•	Ensured defects were addressed with a root-cause mindset, contributing to long-term stability rather than short-term fixes.

Risk & Compliance as an Operational Enabler
	•	Integrated NPT tracking, vulnerability remediation, and EOL technology management into regular delivery workflows.
	•	This helped ensure operational excellence was not limited to speed, but also included security, compliance, and audit readiness.

Team Enablement & Continuity
	•	Supported onboarding of new team members and ensured continuity during team transitions through structured KT and documentation.
	•	Reduced ramp-up time and dependency risks, contributing to sustained delivery efficiency.

Drive Growth – Progress & Demonstrated Outcomes

In 2025, I actively focused on driving growth across three dimensions: my own technical and professional development, the growth of innovation and capability within the organization, and the growth of others through collaboration and mentoring.

Technical & Capability Growth
	•	Expanded my technical breadth across cloud, backend systems, and databases by proactively deepening my understanding of cloud architecture and deployment workflows.
	•	Strengthened system-level thinking by working on NPT remediation and EOL initiatives, which required understanding legacy technologies, platform dependencies, and long-term modernization paths.
	•	Built deeper backend knowledge through close collaboration with DBAs and senior engineers, improving my ability to contribute beyond application-level tasks.

Innovation-Driven Growth
	•	Actively drove innovation efforts by submitting 10+ patent ideas to the Anaqua portal across domains such as system security, cloud, and platform architecture.
	•	Collaborated across teams to refine and strengthen patent submissions, contributing to a stronger and more scalable innovation pipeline.
	•	Mentored and supported first-time inventors, enabling successful filings and helping build confidence and capability within the broader innovation community.
	•	Achieved my first patent grant, marking tangible progress in innovation impact.

Growth Through Strategic Initiatives
	•	Proactively embedded myself early in the IC platform initiative, a key future growth area for the organization.
	•	Invested time to understand architecture, data flows, and system design, positioning myself to contribute meaningfully as the platform scales.

Learning & Continuous Upskilling
	•	Continuously upskilled through structured training, including:
	•	Python for Developers
	•	AI/ML Foundations
	•	Containers and OpenShift
	•	Applied learning to real-world scenarios, strengthening readiness for future platforms and higher-impact responsibilities.

Growth of Others & Knowledge Sharing
	•	Supported the growth of team members and new joiners through onboarding, KT sessions, and ongoing guidance.
	•	Acted as a Learning SPOC, enabling wider participation in training programs and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

Overall Impact
Through sustained learning, innovation leadership, early involvement in strategic platforms, and mentoring of others, I contributed to both immediate and long-term growth for the organization while building the skills and mindset required to take on broader responsibilities.
