In 2025, I consistently delivered strong BAU outcomes while significantly expanding my scope of ownership across delivery, platform risk management, initiatives, innovation, and team enablement. I served as an end-to-end owner and trusted SME for critical systems, proactively took accountability for risk-sensitive areas, and embedded myself early into the IC project. In parallel, I drove innovation through patents, mentored new inventors and team members, and contributed to broader organizational initiatives.

## Overall Impact

2025 has been a year of strong growth, ownership, and increasing impact. I consistently delivered on critical BAU commitments while expanding into strategic initiatives, platform risk ownership, innovation leadership, and team enablement. I have demonstrated reliability, technical depth, and maturity in stakeholder management, while proactively aligning myself with the organization’s future direction through early involvement in IC. I am motivated and prepared to take on greater technical and leadership responsibilities and continue contributing at a higher level.
