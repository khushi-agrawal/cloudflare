Patent Title: Dynamic Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance Enforcement System for On-Chain Asset Tokenization

‚∏ª

üîß Field of Invention

This invention relates to the field of blockchain technology, specifically to systems and methods for enabling dynamic, jurisdiction-specific regulatory compliance enforcement in real-world asset tokenization across multiple regions using smart contracts, graph-based policy engines, and modular on-chain governance techniques.

‚∏ª

üîç Background & Challenges

Current asset tokenization platforms fail to accommodate the diverse and evolving nature of regulatory compliance across jurisdictions. Smart contracts are typically deployed with hardcoded rules specific to one regulatory regime, making them inflexible and legally vulnerable when assets or investors traverse borders. Moreover, off-chain checks are often used for KYC/AML or sanctions enforcement, which breaks the transparency, auditability, and decentralization that tokenization promises.

There exists no scalable, blockchain-native solution that allows a tokenized asset to dynamically adapt to the jurisdiction of an interacting party (investor, regulator, or custodian), nor a way to flexibly enforce a merging of intersecting regulations during cross-border transfers or events.

üí° Summary of the Invention

The invention proposes a modular, on-chain enforcement framework that enables real-time, jurisdiction-specific regulatory compliance for tokenized real-world assets. The system introduces five integrated components:
	1.	Policy Mapping Graph (PMG) Engine
	2.	Composable Compliance Capsules (CCC)
	3.	Jurisdictional Execution Zones (JEZ)
	4.	Regulatory State Transition Machine (RSTM)
	5.	Optional Zero-Knowledge Rule Proofs (ZKRP)

Each component works together to assess, enforce, and audit regulatory constraints as they apply to any given transaction or lifecycle event of a token, based on jurisdictional context, user credentials, asset type, and current token state.

üß± System Components and Architecture

1. Policy Mapping Graph (PMG) Engine
	‚Ä¢	A graph-based rule engine that maps jurisdictional policies (AML, securities, sanctions, tax rules, etc.) as nodes in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
	‚Ä¢	Each node represents a discrete regulatory condition; edges represent precedence or dependency relationships.
	‚Ä¢	The PMG dynamically constructs a compliance path for a token or transaction based on its operating jurisdictions.
	‚Ä¢	Supports real-time updates when laws or regulatory conditions change without requiring redeployment.

Example: If a token must be compliant with U.S. SEC and EU MiFID II, the PMG will merge these nodes and resolve overlaps (e.g., dual KYC requirements) intelligently.

‚∏ª

2. Composable Compliance Capsules (CCC)
	‚Ä¢	Encapsulated smart contract modules (capsules) that each perform a specific regulatory function (e.g., ‚ÄúCheck age > 18‚Äù, ‚ÄúVerify investor whitelist‚Äù, ‚ÄúCheck embargo list‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Capsules are stored on-chain or via decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS).
	‚Ä¢	Loaded and executed at runtime, based on the policy path generated by PMG.

Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Enables composable, upgradeable compliance logic.
	‚Ä¢	Avoids redeploying entire contracts for minor regulatory changes.

‚∏ª

3. Jurisdictional Execution Zones (JEZ)
	‚Ä¢	Smart contract sub-routines and access layers behave differently based on the jurisdictional zone determined at the time of execution.
	‚Ä¢	Zones are inferred from:
	‚Ä¢	User wallet metadata
	‚Ä¢	KYC-linked country codes
	‚Ä¢	IP geolocation via oracles
	‚Ä¢	Asset classification
	‚Ä¢	Smart oracle signals

Each JEZ includes:
	‚Ä¢	Zone-specific rules
	‚Ä¢	Logging policies
	‚Ä¢	Transfer constraints
	‚Ä¢	Auditing obligations

Example: A transaction initiated from the U.S. would trigger JEZ_US rules; if the counterparty is in Singapore, a combined JEZ_US+SG path may be executed.

‚∏ª

4. Regulatory State Transition Machine (RSTM)
	‚Ä¢	A finite-state machine embedded within each token‚Äôs metadata.
	‚Ä¢	Defines allowed states and transitions of the token, based on compliance checkpoints.

Example token states:
	‚Ä¢	Unverified ‚Üí KYC_Passed ‚Üí Jurisdiction_Cleared ‚Üí Tradeable ‚Üí Frozen ‚Üí Burnable

Use cases:
	‚Ä¢	Delayed release mechanisms for high-risk geographies.
	‚Ä¢	Flagging tokens for manual audit.
	‚Ä¢	Disabling transfers upon non-compliance or expiry.

‚∏ª

5. Optional: Zero-Knowledge Rule Proofs (ZKRP)
	‚Ä¢	Users or institutions can prove regulatory compliance using zero-knowledge proofs rather than revealing sensitive data.
	‚Ä¢	Example: ‚ÄúProve I am not on an OFAC list without revealing my name.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	ZKRP logs are stored on-chain for future audit.

Advantages:
	‚Ä¢	High privacy.
	‚Ä¢	Verifiability without exposing sensitive attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Useful in privacy-heavy jurisdictions like the EU.

‚∏ª

üîÅ System Workflow (Textual Flow)
	1.	Tokenization Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Issuer initiates asset tokenization on the platform and selects the operating jurisdictions.
	‚Ä¢	The PMG engine constructs a DAG of compliance rules from the selected regions.
	2.	Token Contract Deployment:
	‚Ä¢	The token smart contract is embedded with JEZ mappings and initialized with an RSTM in the ‚ÄúUnverified‚Äù state.
	‚Ä¢	The relevant CCCs are linked to the contract as compliance modules.
	3.	User Transaction (e.g., Transfer, Redemption):
	‚Ä¢	The platform detects user‚Äôs jurisdiction via off-chain KYC or decentralized identifiers.
	‚Ä¢	JEZ activates for the transaction based on current zone and asset type.
	‚Ä¢	The PMG checks the applicable rules and loads the correct CCCs.
	4.	Execution & Enforcement:
	‚Ä¢	RSTM validates whether the current token state allows the requested operation.
	‚Ä¢	Each CCC is executed; if all pass, the transaction proceeds.
	‚Ä¢	Otherwise, the token is rejected or sent to a pending state for manual audit.
	5.	Logging & Auditing:
	‚Ä¢	All capsule execution logs, zone mappings, and policy decisions are stored on-chain or on a verifiable side-chain for compliance audit.
	6.	ZKRP (if used):
	‚Ä¢	Users submit proof of compliance via zero-knowledge protocols.
	‚Ä¢	The JEZ verifies this proof against policy without revealing raw identity data.
